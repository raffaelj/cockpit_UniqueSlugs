# UniqueSlugs

Unique slugs for collections in Cockpit - https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit

## How to use

Copy this folder into `cockpit/addons/`.

Add these options to `cockpit/config/config.yaml` to specify the collections and field names for slug generation:

```yaml
unique.slugs:
    collections:
        pages     : title
        products  : name
```

all options:

```yaml
# unique slugs
unique.slugs:
    all.collections : false # default: false
    slug.name       : slug  # default: slug
    collections:
        # collectionname  : fieldname
        pages             : title
        products          : name
```

## Notes:

Your collection doesn't need a visible field named "slug", but you can't edit
it if you don't have one.

If you want to hide the slug field for non-admins, just add the following code
to the read permissions of your collection:

```php
<?php
if ($context->user && $context->user['group'] != 'admin')
  $context->options['fields']['slug'] = false;
```

The builtin option to sluggify fields via options `{"slug": true}` in the 
backend uses Javascript and leads to different results ("ä" becomes "a" 
instead of "ae"). If you want unique slugs, that option is not necessary.
